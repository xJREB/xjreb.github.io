Sure!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I could have considered universities of applied sciences (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fachhochschule\">\"Fachhochschulen\"</a>), which would have led to an immense teaching load.</li>\n<li>We could have waited much longer until I was called for a suitable location, without any certainty.</li>\n<li>We could have considered a long-distance relationship for several years.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these were no options for us.\r\nSo, we decided on the following process: whenever I saw a job posting that I would consider, I first sent her the details.\r\nShe then did some research and decided if she could imagine living and working in this city.\r\nIf this was the case, I sent the application, otherwise, she vetoed it (which did happen sometimes).</p>\n<h2>Diversity of Application Processes</h2>\n<p>I started to send out applications in August 2022, a bit more than 2 years after my PhD defense.\r\nI had no real idea how many I would need until I scored my first offer.\r\nReading the few reports available online had scared me a bit because most had mentioned dozens of applications, some over 100.\r\nMy guess is that this sample was skewed by the US job market, where people seem to send out many more applications, but I could be wrong.\r\nIn total, I sent out 11 applications over a period of ~5 months.\r\n10 of them were for Europe, among them, e.g., 4 in the Nordics, 2 in Germany, and 2 in the Netherlands.\r\nEven though most required the same documents (with some exceptions), there were often differences between the format and the number of pages.\r\nI obviously adjusted the letter of motivation every time, but in a lot of cases, I also had to shorten or extend other documents, or convert them into a certain format, most often for the teaching statement.\r\nThe different places also requested between 0 and 4 letters of references as a minimum, most often 3.\r\nEven though I had my basic set of documents ready, some applications took me surprisingly much effort, especially if they required me to fill in parts of my CV into some web form again...\r\nI also applied to 2 universities who share the same CS department.\r\nTo my great surprise (and frustration), the requested documents and process couldn't have been more different.\r\n(Spoiler alert: one of the processes was considerable worse from my applicant perspective.)</p>\n<p>My applications were also processed very differently depending on the university.\r\nBetween 1 and 3 stages needed to be passed until a potential final offer.\r\nSome processes included external reviews, some didn't.\r\nSome had quick initial virtual interviews before the onsite ones, some didn't.\r\nOne even required to submit a video presentation of myself.\r\nThe onsite interviews were very different, too.\r\nAll included some form of presentation and a typical interview part with questions from the hiring committee.\r\nBut the requested presentation content, the allocated presentation time, and which other activities took place could vary considerably.\r\nFor example, requested presentation durations were between 15 and 40 minutes, and, during one onsite interview, I even had to perform a short teaching activity for a given topic with real students.\r\nSo, be ready to adjust to the circumstances of a given application process!\r\nI tried to visualize parts of this diversity in the Sankey diagram below.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block;

</span></p>\n<p>For 3 of my 11 applications, I was rejected right away.\r\nThe universities that disclosed this number received over 100 applications for the position.\r\nHowever, I also reached the final stage for 5 universities.\r\nOne position was scratched by the rector after the interviews.\r\nI never received the ranking of candidates for that one.\r\nBut I also received 2 offers.\r\nDuring the negotiations with them, 3 other interview invitations reached me.\r\nBut once it became clear that I would reach an agreement at the VU Amsterdam, I declined all of these and withdrew my applications.\r\nI decided to be fairly transparent during this process and clearly communicated other applications and offers.\r\nI was pleasantly surprised how well people took this, but maybe I got lucky and the committee heads I interacted with were unusually professional and rational people.\r\nSo, decide for yourself what you want to communicate when.\r\nAnd whatever you do, don't try to play games, e.g., accepting one job to suddenly decline it to go for another offer that just dropped.\r\nThis is not only unethical but also irrational in the long run: academic fields are smaller than you think and people definitely talk.\r\nPlaying these games in academia could substantially harm your reputation and get you blacklisted at various levels.\r\nAlso think of the time and effort that goes into such application processes!\r\nSo, take your time with the decision, ask for more time if needed, but if you accept an offer, stick to your word!</p>\n<p>Regarding the transparency of the 11 application processes, there were again huge differences.\r\nIn some cases, it was extremely opaque what was currently happening or what stage my own application was currently in.\r\nSeveral times, the application deadline was extended (sometimes by several months) without clearly communicating this, let alone why they had done this.\r\nSeveral places didn't announce a preliminary timeline.\r\nIn one case, I already thought I was out and then received the interview invitation close to reaching the end of my ongoing negotiations.\r\nThey had simply taken an unusually long time to process the applications.\r\nLastly, I still haven't received the official rejection from one place, unfortunately a German \"tradition\"...\r\nI only know that I'm out because I know someone who attended the interview there.\r\nHowever, there were also great examples of transparency, most of them from the Nordics:\r\nclearly communicated timelines for the different stages, emails detailing what would happen next as soon as a stage was finalized, results of the external reviews, and great write-ups what to expect for the final interview.\r\nIt definitely is possible for universities to make the applicants' lives easier.\r\nIf you are unsure about your current status at a place you care about and need this info to make a decision, write to them!</p>\n<h2>My Frustration With the German Academic System</h2>\n<p>Finally, I want to voice my disillusionment with the prospects of an academic career in Germany.\r\nDon't get me wrong: I think I received an excellent education here, had very benevolent PhD advisors, and met a ton of great and friendly people at German universities.\r\nBut, over the years, I also realized that the German academic system (as a whole, not on an individual basis) doesn't care about early-career researchers.\r\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_professorship\">Junior Professorships</a>, the German equivalent to Assistant Professorships, are still fairly rare and often blatantly offered without a tenure track.\r\nOnly 2 of my 11 applications were for German universities.\r\nI did not select them because these were great places for my field, but simply because they were the only German ones that I could find for Software Engineering over a period of more than 6 months (excluding non-tenure-track ones).\r\nHowever, it also would have been pointless for me to apply for Full Professorships: with my academic age, I would never have been invited for an interview, especially without having a habilitation.\r\nThere are also many offers for temporary \"Junior Group Leader\" positions, where you basically perform the same duties as an Assistant Professor, but without tenure track and with less salary, in short an exploitation of Postdocs without giving them any job safety or prospects.\r\nGermany also doesn't have Associate Professorship positions, meaning that you either have to make the jump from postdoc to Full Professor, which is incredibly difficult, or from Junior Professor to Full Professor, wich is also difficult because there are so few Junior Professorships and several don't even have a tenure track.\r\nThis frustration of German early-career researchers has culminated on social media under the hashtag #ichbinhanna (\"I am Hanna\").\r\nYou can read more about it in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01178-6\">this article</a> in Nature Human Behaviour or on <a href=\"https://ichbinhanna.wordpress.com/english-version/\">this website</a> from the hashtag initiators.\r\nI definitely will be a bit sad to leave Stuttgart and my great research group, but I won't shed a single tear for leaving the German academic system.\r\nI very much look forward to performing excellent research and teaching for a country that really values early-career researchers, and can only suggest that other young highly-qualified researchers do the same, until the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) finally realizes that they are driving our country's academic system into the ground.</p>\n<p>#ichwarhanna</p>\n<p>Disclaimer:\r\nAll of this is written from my subjective and European perspective on the academic job market for an Assistant Professorship in Software Engineering at research universities (not universities of applied sciences).\r\nNot all points will be directly transferrable to other subfields of Computer Science, even less to other scientific disciplines, and probably also not to the US.</p>\n<p>Acknowledgements:\r\nI am very grateful to <a href=\"https://ineed.coffee/\">Daniel Graziotin</a> and <a href=\"https://marvin-wyrich.de/\">Marvin Wyrich</a> for reviewing a first draft of
